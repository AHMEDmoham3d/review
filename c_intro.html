    <h2>Importance and Uses of C Language</h2>
    
    <p>The C language is considered one of the oldest and most influential programming languages. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, aiming to provide an efficient way to develop systems. C serves as the foundation for many modern programming languages.</p>
    
    <h3>Importance of C Language:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> C is known for its high performance and speed, making it ideal for developing applications that require quick responsiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Memory Control:</strong> C provides precise control over memory management, allowing programmers to optimize application performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> C programs can run on multiple operating systems with minimal modifications, facilitating software development across different platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundation for Learning Other Languages:</strong> C is a basis for many other programming languages, making understanding it essential for programmers.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Support Community:</strong> C has a large community of programmers, making it easy to find resources, tutorials, and support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Uses of C Language:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating System Development:</strong> C is used in developing operating systems like UNIX and Linux.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Programming:</strong> C is used for programming embedded systems and small devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> C is used to create desktop applications and server applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> C is used in developing many games due to its high performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Applications:</strong> C is used in applications that require complex calculations, such as simulations and modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evolution of C Language:</h3>
    <p>Since its development, C has undergone many advancements, including ANSI C and ISO C standards. These standards have helped improve the language and ensure its compatibility across different operating systems. Additionally, the tools and libraries associated with C have evolved, increasing its efficiency and usage in various fields.</p>

    <h3>How to Include a Library:</h3>
    <p>In C, you can include a library using the <code>#include</code> directive. The most common library is the standard input/output library <code>stdio.h</code>. Here’s an example:</p>
    <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Welcome to C Language!\n");
    return 0;
}

//output:Welcome to C Language!\n
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>main()</h3>
    The code starts from main function and runs what's in it in order.<br><br>

    <h3>printf()</h3>
    The command printf() is responsible for printing in the language C<br><br>
    
    <h3>" "</h3>
    If we want to print anything in the print command we must use.<br><br>

   <h3>return 0;</h3>
   She is responsible for closing the program.
