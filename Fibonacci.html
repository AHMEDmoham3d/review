        <h2>Importance and Uses of Fibonacci Sequence in C++</h2>
        
        <p>The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. This sequence is important in computer science, mathematics, and nature.</p>
        
        <h3>Importance of Fibonacci Sequence in C++:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Occurrences:</strong> Fibonacci numbers appear in nature, such as in the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the pattern of flower petals, and the structure of shells.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithm Design:</strong> Fibonacci sequences are used in algorithm optimization, dynamic programming, and to explain recursion.</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Ratio:</strong> The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio, which is widely used in art and architecture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Write the Fibonacci Sequence:</h3>
        
        <p>In C++, Fibonacci sequences can be generated using either **recursion** or **iteration**. Below are examples of both approaches.</p>
        
        <h4>Recursive Fibonacci Example:</h4>
        
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    else
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int num = 6;
    std::cout << "Fibonacci of " << num << " is: " << fibonacci(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
        </pre>

        <h4>Iterative Fibonacci Example:</h4>
        
        <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void fibonacciIterative(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, next;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= 1)
            next = i;
        else {
            next = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = next;
        }
        std::cout << next << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
    int num = 6;
    std::cout << "First " << num << " Fibonacci numbers: ";
    fibonacciIterative(num);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
        </pre>

        <h3>Applications of Fibonacci Sequence:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithm Efficiency:</strong> Fibonacci is a common example in dynamic programming and algorithm efficiency analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Fibonacci numbers are used in number theory and combinatorics.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Analysis:</strong> Fibonacci retracement levels are used in stock market technical analysis to predict price movements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fibonacci in Nature:</h3>
        
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence is observed in biological settings, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the branching of trees. These patterns optimize the exposure of leaves to sunlight and space for growth.</p>
