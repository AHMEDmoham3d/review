    <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is C++?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension to the C language.</li>
                <li>It combines both high-level and low-level programming capabilities, making it suitable for a variety of applications from system software to game development.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li><strong>Key Features of C++:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, which makes it easier to manage and organize large projects.</li>
                <li>Offers powerful tools for memory management through direct manipulation of pointers and memory addresses.</li>
                <li>Includes rich libraries such as the **Standard Template Library (STL)** for data structures and algorithms.</li>
                <li>Supports multiple paradigms including procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li><strong>Common Uses of C++:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**Game Development**: Due to its speed and efficiency, C++ is commonly used in creating complex, performance-demanding games.</li>
                <li>**System/Embedded Programming**: C++ provides direct access to hardware, making it ideal for system-level applications like operating systems, drivers, and embedded systems.</li>
                <li>**Software Development**: Many desktop applications, such as Adobe products and Microsoft Office, are developed using C++.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li><strong>Advantages of C++:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly efficient and fast, making it a top choice for performance-critical applications.</li>
                <li>Flexible due to its multi-paradigm support, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their task.</li>
                <li>Cross-platform compatibility, allowing C++ code to run on different operating systems with minimal changes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
